# Quiz: Week 07

Open the `styles.css` file and add rulesets to meet the following requirements. Do not edit the `index.html` file or anything between the commented lines in `styles.css`, only add your CSS for each size after the comment for each size.

When you are done, you can compress your folder into a zip archive and upload it on the portal in the CSET-110 assignment **Quiz: Week 07**. If you don't know how to make a zip file, run `zip -r quiz-07.zip quiz-07/` in this folder's parent directory to create a zip file of this folder.
